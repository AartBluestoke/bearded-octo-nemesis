You'll want to run this from the command line, with "java -jar nameofjarfile.jar"
followed by the arguments. Run it with no arguments to see the arguments it
needs.

It needs the path to the SIDE.srg, SIDE.exc, methods.csv and fields.csv from
MCP, as well as the input and output files, and the side number, where SIDE is
"client" (side number 0) or "server" (side number 1).
